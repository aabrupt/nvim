# Urgobalt's Neovim configuration
_The configuration is adapted in such a way that it can be used using NixOS and its immutable file system._

## UI
I am using 3 things to style the editor, keeping it simple. The color scheme is [rasmus.nvim](https://github.com/kvrohit/rasmus.nvim). It is a simple color scheme based on tokyonight and neon. The main difference is the fact that I am a big fan of the green and monochromatic nature of the theme. [transparent.nvim](https://github.com/xiyaowong/transparent.nvim); This plugin is optional. It only make the background transparent and provide 3 editor commands to toggle the effect. I did it manually for a while. The statusbar is created using [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim), it makes customizing the statusbar dead simple using modules. Mine is custom, however mostly copied from one of the examples provided.

## Package management
I am not using a package manage directly within my Neovim configuration and is instead handling all that within the operating system. This is because Mason create a separate layer of complexity since it's package management is not declarative, and may become out of sync when using multiple operating systems at once.

## LSP
The LSP is configured using mainly two tools; [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim). __nvim-lspconfig__ is directly resposible for setting up the built-in Neovim LSP Client with the language servers and their configurations. This include some tooling such as logging and the `LspInfo` editor command. The `LspInfo` command show information about current running lsp connected and disconnected from the current buffer. Telescope is not directly a tool for LSP and is more this generic frame which _may_ contain tools that interact with the LSP. Such tools in the scope of this project is lookup of symbol references, implementation, definition, and more. Telescope also offer project navigation, super powerful tool that extends beyond what this description can contain.

## Formatting
For formatting in this project, I am using [conform](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim). I only have a very simple setup using __some__ formatters, only where the language does not directly contain a proper formatting solution with its LSP. You guessed it right, I am using LSP fallback for everything else. I am striving to not having to deal with downloading and setting up formatters all the time.

## Linting
_This is an unfinished part of the configuration._
I am usually not using linters within my projects and only have a half-baked solution using [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint).

## Completion
I am using [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp). It has great integration with other plugins and neovim functionality. It is easy to configure and has just the right amount of features. It has smart handling of key mappings, support for LSP, and great customizability for plugins.

## Git integration
I am mainly using two plugins for handling Git from within Neovim.

[gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) is a great plugin for interacting with git dynamically using floating windows and other cool features. It is not made to do the good old actions such as `push`, `pull`, etcetera, but is rather a plugin that adds just enough git information to your Neovim session to know you are a real coder. This plugin also provide the `git blame` floating window that we all love so much.

[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is one of the best Neovim plugins. It is a __MUST HAVE__ within all neovim configuratins. It provides the terminal command `git` as the editor command `Git`, reworked to be used within Neovim seamlessly. Simply running it without arguments will bring up a dashboard where you can access every command using keybindings instead of declaratively using the terminal command. You will also have a beautiful list of the staged, unstaged and untracked files within your repo. All other commands also work when ran using the `Git` terminal command, but it will actually have a proper output and handle input properly rather than simply using the `!git` command.

## Navigation
Navigation within Neovim is __VERY IMPORTANT__ and just as important is that it suits you. You can have a file tree in a window on the side using [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua), you can have tabs, windows, buffer, and plugins to interact with all individually or all at once. I want to stress the fact that you should put in time to create a proper workflow that suits you.

### Harpoon
[Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) is a plugin that make navigating the files (plural) you are currently working on a breeze. You add files to a list and then use the keybinding to navigate to the file in that list. A very simple plugin, but one of my must have plugins since it is __incredibly__ convenient.

### Telescope
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) has a lot of built in navigation functionality. You can open a directory and fuzzy find the file you are searching for. You can grep a certain term within _all files_ within a directory, for example looking for a symbol or function with a certain name. It has massive [git functionality](#git%20integration). Telescope's functionality is absolutely massive without even mentioning telescope's extensive plugin support.

### Leap
For navigation within the buffer, I use [leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim). It is a pretty simply but amazign plugin that allows you to just to any word within your current viewport using only the first two characters of that word. If you can read it, you can _leap_ to it. This is a must for editing markdown files, since I don't use line-breaks (line-breaks looks horrible).

## Terminal
_Outdated and half baked since I am using Tmux_
I am using [terminal.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/terminal.nvim), which is a lightweight terminal that opens up in a new buffer. Super simple and it can be used without almost any configuration.

## Notes
I have put a lot of time into creating a proper note experiance. These are the main things I am using to make the experiance as good as possible. [Folding](#folding) will be a separate heading since it does not only effect markdown, but I put time into it mainly because of markdown.

### Obsidian
_I am thinking about migrating to [marksman](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman) since it is standalone from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)._
I am mainly using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for taking notes, which makes it a no-brainer to use [obsidian.nvim](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim). It has a lot of cool features such as opening a __table of contents__ using [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), creating new notes, managing frontmatter, renaming notes, and basic markdown UI. I am using another plugin for UI since it is more extensive, but it is there and pretty good.

### Render markdown
Since I want the experience of writing markdown to be as seamless as possible, then I want the experience of reading it to be just as good. The plugin [render-markdown](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim) bombards your markdown document with syntax sugar, making it much more readable.

### Spell checking
TODO

## Folding
_Currently kinda half-baked, even after a lot of time configuring it._
This will be very short. I am using [ufo](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-ufo?tab=readme-ov-file), because it is the most extensive plugin directed at folding on the market right now.

## SQL
There is an absolutely amazing plugin for managing SQL directly from within Neovim. This is a __HUGE__ upgrade from other editors I have used. [vim-dadbod](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod) with [vim-dadbod-ui](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-dadbod-ui) makes interacting with databases a breeze. This is one of my must have's. You can store previous interactions, connect to most database types, without having to rely on a separate application. It also has integration with [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp). What does it mean to have integration with the completion engine? After querying the database once, you get completions for __ALL OF THE SYMBOLS__ within your database; Table names, columns, you name it. It is just way too amazing to leave out, even if I don't use it more than once every month or even less.
